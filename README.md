# PYTHON SCRIPTS FOR DOWNLOADING AND LIVE PLOTTING OF HEXOSKIN DATA #

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get your application up and running.

### What is this repository for? ###

* Direct download of Hexoskin Data by simply running the Python script lastmodof5datatypes.py which saves the data into separate .csv files for separate record IDs. Also creates a file lastmod.p that keeps track of record IDs already synced.
* Direct download of Hexoskin ECG Data by simply running the Python script ecgwithoutlastmod.py which saves the data into separate .csv files for separate record IDs.
* View static graphs of your choice of datatype using staticallchoicesgraph.py (requires installation of files in the "Requirements" folder in the repository)
* View live graph of Heart Rate on an HTML file using pubnubtograph.html and pytopubnub.py script (can be run on Heroku)
